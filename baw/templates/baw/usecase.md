A very brief description of the typical work flow to administer or participate in a count using the Bike And Walk app.

###Create a Count Event (Count Admin)

1.	Establish Count Location records:
	The count administrator will create a count event. A set of database records that specify the locations where counts are to be conducted and the traveler attributes that are to be counted.

2.	Solicit people to perform the count for specific locations.

3.	Assign people to count locations.

4.	Contact people with their count assignments and instructions.

	Emailed instructions will include a link to a unique URL that will give them access via smart phone or laptop to the a pre-configured instance of the web app for their location.

###Conduct Count: (Individuals)

*	On the date of the count people perform the count using either the web app or paper forms.  

	*Using Web App:* Follow the link provided in the assignment email and the preconfigured count form will open in your web browser.   
	Counts are uploaded automatically to the database if a connection is available.     
	If the count location is outside of wireless coverage area be sure to access the link before going to the count location. An internet connection is not required to perform the count but you will need to submit your data using the app once you have an internet connection. 
		
	*Using Paper forms:* Completed forms are delivered to the count administrator who manually enters the results into the database.
