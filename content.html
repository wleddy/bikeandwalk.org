<h1>About the Bike and Walk app.</h1>
<p>
	Well, thing have moved on... As many have noticed, both the iPhone and Android versions of the app have grown long in the tooth
	and not been updated in ages. Long story there. I won't bore you with that. It has since been removed from both app stores.
</p>
<p>
	But there's good news! We (and there actually is a "we" this time) are working on a new web based version that will make updates
	easier for us and will be an actual open source project that others will be able to easily contribute to or fork to make their very own version.
</p>
<p>
	We don't have a timeline for the new version yet, but hope to have it ready for the public shortly after the first of the year 2016. Keep your
	fingers crossed!
