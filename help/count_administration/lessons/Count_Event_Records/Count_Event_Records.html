This is the time zone where the count is taking place.</p><p>Answer the question "Will it be Daylight Savings time?" by clicking yes or no. If Daylight savings time is not observed where you'll be counting the answer would always be know.</p><p><strong>Why do we need to know?</strong> All trip times are recoded as your local time. The computer that holds the central data store may not be in the same time zone as you and so it needs to know the time where you are so it knows when the count starts and ends for you.</p></div>	</div>	<div class="clear"></div>	<div id="step_2" class="lessonStep top">	        <h2 class="StepTitle">Set up your Travelers</h2>		<div class="image"><img src="../images/Count_Event_Records/media_1454462038806.png" width="382" height="335" alt="" /></div> <div class="instructions">  <p>We use the term "Travelers" to refer to the types of activity that you're going to be counting.
